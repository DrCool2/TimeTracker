1) Confirm that Entries and Tasks and Lovs should be Model Associated correctly?
It works, but I don't know if it should work that way. Too Complicated?
Maybe I need to just make one table for Entries and make a column called Tasks since LOV table kind of replicates the list of task options?

2) Entries
  - change time zone to Eastern
  - list Task Name instead of ID as a Dropdown box
